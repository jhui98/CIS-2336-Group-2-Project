                        <li> Mix the milk and vinegar and allow it to sit four around two minutes </li>
                        <li> 
                            Combine the dry ingredients together and whisk them. After, whisk the egg, milk, and butter into the dry ingredients until they combine. 
                            (Make sure to not overwhisk)
                        </li>
                        <li> Heat a preferrably nonstick pan, then melt a smear of butter to give the pancake a golden brown crust </li>
                        <li> 
                            Pour a third of a cup of batter into the skillet, and spread it flat. Add some blueberries on top, and cook until bubbles start to build up. 
                            Flip and let it cook for another minute and a half - the pancakes should be fluffy and cooked. Repeat for more pancakes.
                        </li>
                        <li> Top with butter, syrup, and any other toppings. Grab one (or the whole stack) and enjoy your breakfast!</li>
