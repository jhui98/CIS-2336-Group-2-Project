                    <ol style="text-align: left;">
                        <li> Begin cooking your egg(s) to preference. Soft-boiled works best in my opinion, but regardless of how you prefer them, begin cooking the egg before your ramen so that they can be finished at a closer time. </li>
                        <li> In a medium saucepan, boil 2 cups of water for the ramen. While that boils, prepare your SPAM. Most SPAM cans contain about 12 oz. each. To get a good amount, slice 1/3 of the block off and slice that piece to preference, either in cubes or whole slices. For a more authentic taste for your SPAM, grill it to a crispy, golden brown.</li>
                        <li> Drop ramen block inside once water has reached a rolling boil. If you would like a simple way to heat the SPAM, throw it into the saucepan as well. </li>
                        <li> Cook for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Make sure to check on egg(s) as well to avoid overcooking. </li>
                        <li> After 3 minutes of boiling, turn off heat. Stir in the seasoning packet that came with the ramen, sriracha sauce, and chili powder. Once the egg(s) is/are done cooking, add them as well.</li>
                        <li> Pour into a bowl, adding 1 tbs. of chopped green onions (or to preference). If you grilled your SPAM, add it on top as the finishing touch. </li>
                    </ol>

                <td><div id="desc"> This recipe is a simple, quick, cost-efficient meal that can be made in under 10 minutes. Using a combination of ramen, SPAM, and eggs, you can enjoy a nice portion of protein while also being filled up by the ramen. To add the right touch of spice and flavoring to the meal, Sriracha sauce and chili powder can be added, though any other topping can be added/subtracted based on your preference. </div></td>
