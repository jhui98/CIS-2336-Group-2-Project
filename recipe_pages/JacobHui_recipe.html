                    <ol style="text-align: left;">
                        <li> Combine soy sauce, vineagr, garlic, pepper, bay leaves, and brown sugar and mix to create the marinade. </li>
                        <li> In a bag add the chicken and the marinade making sure to mix and check that everything is covered. </li>
                        <li> Marinade overnight or if in a rush at least 30 minutes. </li>
                        <li> After marinading, in a dutch oven add enough oil to coat the bottom and get color on all sides of the chicken. </li>
                        <li> At this stage you are not trying ot cook the chicken just get some color.  </li>
                        <li> Once the chicken has color, remove it and set it aside. </li>
                        <li> Add the remaining liquid form the marinade and the water. </li>
                        <li> Bring everything up to a low simmer and add the chicken, making sure that the liquid covers the chicken. </li>
                        <li> Cover and simmer for 15-20 min. </li>
                        <li> (Optional) At this point you can begin to make some rice to complete the traditional meal, but it would still be great without it.  </li>
                        <li> After the initial 15-20 min turn the chicken over and simmer for another 15-20 min or until the chicken is cooked through. </li>
                        <li> Once it's finished you can serve out of the pot or you can remove the chicken and spoon it over when serving. </li>
                        <li> If the sauce is too thin you can simmer to thicken or you can add water to make it thinner. </li>
                        <li> Top with green onions, serve and enjoy! </li>

                <td> <div id="desc"> Chicken Adobo is actually the national dish in the Philippines. It is a very easy and rich dish that is simmered in a soy sauce and vinegar based marinade. Adobo can be made with with chicken or pork, but I chose chicken for this recipe as it's my favorite, and it is also traditionally served over rice to soak up the rich sauce that the chicken is also marinated in. It's a super easy dish that instanltly becomes a favorite for most. </div></td>
