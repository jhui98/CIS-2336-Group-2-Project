                    <h2>How to bake a Tres Leches Cake</h2>
                    <ol style="text-align: left;">
                        <li> Warm oven and prepare baking dish </li>
                        <li> Whisk dry ingredients: sift cake flour into a medium mixing bowl. Add in baking powder and salt and whisk 20 seconds, set aside.</li>
                        <li> Cream butter and sugar: in the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment cream together butter and sugar until very pale and fluffy. </li>
                        <li> Blend in eggs and flavoring: Mix in eggs one at a time, blending until well combined after each addition. Mix in vanilla.</li>
                        <li>Spread into prepared pan: pour batter into prepared baking dish and spread into an even layer (it will seem like a thin layer).</li>
                        <li> Bake until set: bake in preheated oven until toothpick inserted into center comes out clean, about 24 – 28 minutes.
Remove from oven and let cool on a wire rack, about 45 minutes. Once cool pierce cake many times all over with a long-pronged fork.</li>
                        <li>Make milk mixture: In a large mixing bowl whisk together milk, 1/2 cup heavy cream, the sweetened condensed milk and the evaporated milk until blended.</li>
                        <li>Let cake rest: pour milk mixture evenly over cake then cover and refrigerate at least 6 hours (or up to 3 days). This allows time for cake to soak up the liquid, don’t skip resting time.</li>
                        <li>Prepare topping: In a large mixing bowl using an electric hand mixer (or using the stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment) whip heavy cream until soft peaks form.
Add in sugar and vanilla and whip until stiff peaks form. Spread over chilled cake.</li>
                        <li> Garnish cake and serve: cut cake into slices and serve cold garnished with strawberries or dust with cinnamon if desired. Store cake in refrigerator.</li>
                    </ol>

                <td><div id="desc"> The tres leches cake is a traditional hispanic recipe that has been become very popular. It is a simple recipe, but it is not a recipe that can be made by jsut anybody. This recipe requires patience, as a simple part of just adding milk can make the recipe completely different if done improper. My recommendation to this recipe is, enjoy cold with coffee. </div></td>
